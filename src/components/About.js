          One of the hobbies I've kept since childhood is my love for video
          games.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was a child, my dad introduced me to the Nintendo N64 console
          and the Playstation 2, playing video games with my father are some of
          my favorite childhood memories. I started playing video games on my
          own early on, around age 6 or 7, and some of my first games included
          The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Shadow of the Colossus.
          These games opened my imagination to the possibilities of fantasy, but
          it also taught me important lessons about myself and how to overcome
          challenges. For instance, I got frustrated often on puzzles my tiny
          mind couldn't figure out yet, and often ran to my dad for assistance,
          especially as I first started out. He always told me "try it at least
          5 times, then I'll help you". It was difficult for me to try to
          persevere when I thought I had exhausted my options, but the feeling
          of overcoming a challenge through trial and error and the relief of my
          frustration when I figured something out on my own was euphoric. I'm
          glad my dad didn't give in every time I asked for help, he gave me the
          opportunity to discover how to solve challenges by myself and have the
          confidence to confront my own frustrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, I turn to video games for the same euphoria of overcoming
          challenges by myself. When it feels like I'm not progressing in my own
          life as expediently as I want to, video games give me the chance to
          feel like I'm still progressing regardless. It's also the best way
          I've found to explore fantasies I couldn't explore otherwise, like
          being an adventurerer in an unknown land or a simple farmer who tends
          to their crops.

          Another thing I do in my free time that helps me relax is journal. I
          journal every day, mostly for practical reasons such as keeping track
          of my schedule and my goals, but also as an emotional outlet. I've
          found it to be enlightening to look back at old entries, to remind
          myself how much has changed and how far I've come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hobby started my Freshmen year of High School, which was my first
          year in a traditional school setting as I was homeschooled by my
          mother up until then. They gave us simple school planners to keep
          track of our homework and other things, and while the other children
          hated to keep track of everything, I quickly fell in love with
          organizing my days and seeing my life in an easy to digest format.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's helped me not only keep track of the things I need to do, but the
          things I want to do. Finding equilibrium in life, a balance of work
          and play and everything in between, is a difficult task for everyone;
          but journaling helps me manage my energy and avoid becoming
          overwhelmed.

          Whenever I have some spare time, and I don't care for journaling or
          looking at a screen, I enjoy to get lost in a good book. I must admit
          I fell off reading for pleasure for many years during High School,
          when everything I read had to have a purpose, but recently I've made
          an effort to reclaim my love of the written word. When I was a child I
          used to devour books by the week, the feeling of being lost in a story
          fueled only by words on a page and my imagination was addicting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays it's difficult to recapture that same addicting feeling of
          being lost in the words, partially I believe due to our societal
          addiction to the screens in our pockets. I've found myself scrolling
          for hours without end when I could be doing something more productive
          with my time, and I hope to fill that void with physical books
          instead. Or at the very least books I can consume on my phone or
          laptop.

          Another hobby of mine that I'm trying to reclaim that I haven't done
          as often as I wish I had in recent years, is writing. Creative writing
          was what consumed most of my time during middle school and high
          school, what better than consuming a story than creating it myself?
          Storytelling as an art fascinates me in all forms of media, and
          everything begins as a written story, every show and movie has a
          script somewhere. One of my biggest goals in life is to create and
          publish my own story, possibly multiple if I'm given the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important lesson that creative writing has taught me over the years
          is that the rough draft is both the most important step of any
          project, as well as the least important to get perfect. It's tempting
          to fall into the paradox of a perfectionist, but the truth is
          everything great was once a messy rough draft, and the only way to get
          a truly great product is through thorough revision and careful
          polishing.
