          Hi, welcome to my portfolio website. Perhaps you're considering
          whether or not to hire me, perhaps you know me in real life, or
          perhaps you're just a wanderer; either way good to see you here.
        </p>
        <p>
          In December 2021 I graduated from the Fullstack Academy Javascript
          program, powered by CalPoly. It was a rigorous 6 month program, that I
          wish lasted longer than it did. It taught me many important things not
          only related to Javascript and programming in general, but time
          management and the direction I wanted my career to go in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not going to lie to you and say programming has been my passion
          since middle school and I love every second of it even the frustrating
          ones, because that wouldn't be the truth. I wasn't sure where I wanted
          my education to go after High School for a while, but I knew I didn't
          want to invest in a degree that I didn't even know I'd be interested
          in after a couple years. In my career research I noticed one that
          constantly came up on those websites of "highest paying careers" was
          programming. I never particularly saw myself as someone who would go
          into a field like that, but I took a leap of faith on the Javascript
          program.
        </p>

          My initial reaction was repulsion and despair. It was so frustrating,
          and I didn't think I was good at it, but I didn't want to quit right
          away when I'd already paid for it; and I'm glad I chose to challenge
          myself to finish the program despite my first impressions. The feeling
          at the end of it when I was able to produce a fully functioning online
          bakery, something I didn't think possible for me at the beginning of
          the six months when I struggled with the basics, made me see that
          programming is as learnable a skill as any other. It is in many ways
          like learning another language, how some choose to describe it, but in
          many ways I see it as learning math.
        </p>

          Something about programming that both appeals and scares me is that
          everyone is a student when it comes to programming. It's impossible to
          know and memorize everything to do with coding, especially when it
          comes to multiple languages, so it's likely that one programmer knows
          something that another one does not. This appeals to me because when
          it's a certainty I won't know everything to do with coding, it's
          easier to admit I don't know something without feeling shame; but it
          also scares me because it's also easy to feel like there's so much I
          don't know that I maybe should know.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the truth is, there's too much knowledge out there in general to
          try to cram into one's head, and no one can know it all. We're all
          students in every aspect of our lives, and there will always be more
          to learn, and room to grow. That's the mentality I hope to carry with
          me as I move forward and carve my own path in life.
